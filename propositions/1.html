<strong>To construct an equilateral triangle on a given finite straight-line</strong>
---
Let AB be the given finite straight-line.So it is required to construct
an equilateral triangle on the straight-line AB.
---
Let the circle BCD with center A and radius <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">B have
been drawn , and again let the circle ACE with center B and radius  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">A    have been drawn.
---
And let the straight-lines CA and CB have been joined from the point  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, where the circles cut one another,&dagger; to the
points A and B (respectively).
---
And since the point A is the center of the circle  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4">,AC is equal to  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5"> [Def. 1.15]. Again, since the point
B is the center of the circle  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q6" >, BC is equal to BA
[Def. 1.15]. But CA was also shown (to be) equal to AB.
---
Thus, CA and CB are each equal to  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q7">. But things equal
to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
---
Thus, CA is also equal to  <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q8">. Thus, the three (straight lines) CA, AB, and BC are equal to one another Thus,
the triangle ABC is equilateral, and has been constructed on the given finite straight-line AB. (Which is) the very thing it
was required to do.

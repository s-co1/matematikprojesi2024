<strong>
  If two straight-lines, not lying on the same side, make adjacent angles whose sum is equal to two right-angles with some straight-line, at a point on it, then the two straight-lines will be straight-on with respect to one another.</strong>

For let two straight-lines BC and BD, not lying on the same side, make adjacent angles ABC and ABD whose sum is equal to two right-angles. I say that BD is straight-on with respect to CB.

  For if BD is not straight-on to BC, let BE be drawn from point B at right-angles to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">. Therefore, since straight-line AB stands on straight-line CBE, the angles ABC and <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2"> are equal to two right-angles. Also, the angles ABC and ABD are equal. Thus, (the sum of angles) ABC and ABD is equal to two right-angles. Let ABC have been subtracted from ABC and <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">. Thus, the remainder ABE is equal to the remainder ABD. However, BE is not straight-on with respect to CB. Similarly, we can show that neither is any other line than BD. Thus, CB is straight-on with respect to BD.

  Thus, if two straight-lines, not lying on the same side, make adjacent angles whose sum is equal to two right-angles with some straight-line at a point on it, then the two straight-lines will be straight-on with respect to one another. This is what needed to be demonstrated.

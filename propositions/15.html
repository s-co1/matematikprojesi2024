<strong>
  If two straight-lines cut one another, then they make vertically opposite angles equal to one another.

For let the two straight-lines AB and CD cut one another at point E. I say that angle AEC is equal to angle DEB, and angle CEB is equal to angle AED.

  Since the straight-line AE stands on the straight-line CD, making angles CEA and AED, the angles CEA and AED are equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13]. Again, since the straight-line DE stands on the straight-line AB, making angles AED and <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">, the angles AED and DEB are also equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13]. Therefore, angles CEA and AED are equal to angles AED and DEB [C.N. 1]. Let angle AED be subtracted. Thus, the remaining angle CEA is equal to the remaining angle BED [C.N. 3]. Similarly, it can be shown that angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2"> and angle DEA are also equal.

  Thus, if two straight-lines cut one another, then they make the vertically opposite angles equal to one another. This is what needed to be demonstrated.

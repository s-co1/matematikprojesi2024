Here is the English translation of the text:

"For any triangle, when one of the sides is produced, the external angle is greater than each of the internal and opposite angles.

Let ABC be a triangle, and let one of its sides BC be produced to D. I say that the external angle ACD is greater than each of the internal and opposite angles, CBA and BAC.

  Let AC be cut in half at point E, and let BE be produced in a straight line to point F [Prop. 1.10]. Let BE be made equal to BC [Prop. 1.3], and let FC be joined, and AC be drawn through to point G.

  Since AE is equal to EC, and BE to EF, the two sides AE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF, respectively. Also, angle AEB is equal to angle FEC, for they are vertically opposite angles. Therefore, angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> is greater than angle FEC [Prop. 1.15]. Thus, the base AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle FEC, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides are equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
---
  Thus, angle BAE is equal to angle ECF. But angle ECD is greater than ECF. Thus, angle ACD is greater than angle BAE. Similarly, by having cut BC in half, it can be shown that angle BCG—that is to say, angle ACD—is also greater than angle ABC.

  Thus, for any triangle, when one of the sides is produced, the external angle is greater than each of the internal and opposite angles. This is what needed to be demonstrated.

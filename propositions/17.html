  Let ABC be a triangle. I say that the sum of two angles of triangle ABC taken together in any way is less than two right angles.

  For let BC have been produced to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">.

  And since angle ACD is external to triangle ABC, it is greater than the internal and opposite angle ABC [Prop. 1.16]. Let ACB be added to both. Thus, the sum of the angles ACD and ACB is greater than the sum of the angles ABC and BCA. But the sum of ACD and ACB is equal to two right angles [Prop. 1.13]. Thus, the sum of ABC and BCA is less than two right angles. Similarly, we can show that the sum of BAC and ACB is also less than two right angles, and further that the sum of CAB and ABC is less than two right angles.

  Thus, for any triangle, the sum of two angles taken together in any possible way is less than two right angles. This is what needed to be demonstrated.

<strong>
  In any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle.
</strong>
---
For let ABC be a triangle having side AC greater than AB. I say that angle ABC is also greater than angle BCA.
---
  For since AC is greater than AB, let AD be made equal to AB, and let BD have been joined.
---
  And since angle ADB is external to triangle BCD, it is greater than the internal and opposite angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> [Prop. 1.16]. But ADB is equal to ABD, since side AB is also equal to side AD [Prop. 1.5]. Thus, ABD is also greater than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">. Thus, ABC is much greater than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">.

  Thus, in any triangle, the greater side subtends the greater angle. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

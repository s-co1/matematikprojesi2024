<strong>
  In any triangle, the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

  Let ABC be a triangle having the angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> greater than angle BCA. I say that side <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2"> is also greater than side AB.

  For if not, AC is certainly either equal to, or less than, AB. In fact, AC is not equal to AB. For then angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3"> would also have been equal to ACB [Prop. 1.5]. But it is not. Thus, AC is not equal to AB. Neither, indeed, is AC less than AB. For then angle ABC would also have been less than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> [Prop. 1.18]. But it is not. Thus, AC is not less than AB. But it was shown that AC is not equal to AB either. Thus, AC is greater than AB.

  Thus, in any triangle, the greater angle is subtended by the greater side. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

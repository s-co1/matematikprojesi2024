<strong>to place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line. </strong>
---
Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight-line. So it is required to place a straight-line at point A equal to the given straight-line BC. 
---
For let the straight-line AB have been joined from point A to point B [Post. 1], and let the equilateral triangle DAB have been constructed upon it [Prop. 1.1].
---
And let the straight-lines AE and BF have been produced in a straight-line with DA and DB (respectively) [Post. 2].
And let the circle CGH with center B and radius B<input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> have been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle GKL with center D and radius D<input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2"> have been drawn [Post. 3].
---
Therefore, since the point B is the center of (the circle) CGH, BC is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3"> [Def. 1.15].
---
Again, since the point D is the center of the circle GKL, DL is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> [Def. 1.15].
---
Thus, the remainder AL is equal to the remainder <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5"> [C.N. 3]. But BC was also shown (to be) equal to [<q>question 5</q>] [C.N. 3].
Thus, AL and BC are each equal to BG. But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
---
Thus, AL is also equal to BC. Thus, the straight-line AL, equal to the given straight-line BC, has been placed at the given point A. 
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do. <br>

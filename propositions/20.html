<strong>
  In any triangle, the sum of two sides taken together in any possible way is greater than the remaining side.

Let ABC be a triangle. I say that in triangle ABC, the sum of two sides taken together in any way is greater than the remaining side. So, the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC, the sum of AB and BC is greater than AC, and the sum of BC and CA is greater than AB.

For let BA have been drawn through to point D, and let AD be made equal to CA [Prop. 1.3], and let <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> be joined. Therefore, since DA is equal to AC, the angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2"> is also equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3"> [Prop. 1.5]. Thus, <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> is greater than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5">. And since <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q6"> is a triangle having the angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q7"> greater than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q8">, and the greater angle subtends the greater side [Prop. 1.19], <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q9"> is thus greater than <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q10">. But DA is equal to AC. Thus, the sum of <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q11"> and AC is greater than BC. Similarly, we can show that the sum of AB and BC is also greater than CA, and the sum of BC and CA than AB.

Thus, in any triangle, the sum of two sides taken together in any possible way is greater than the remaining side. Which is the very thing it was required to show.

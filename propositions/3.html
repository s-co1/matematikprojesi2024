<strong>For two given unequal straight-lines, to cut off from the greater a straight-line equal to the lesser.</strong>
---
Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines, of which let the greater be AB. So it is required to cut off a straight-line equal to the lesser <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> from the greater AB.
---
Let the line AD, equal to the straight-line C, have been placed at point <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">. And let the circle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3"> have been drawn with center A and radius AD [Post. 3].
---
And since point A is the center of circle DEF, <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> is equal to AD [Def. 1.15]. But, C is also equal to AD. Thus, [<q>question 4</q>] and C are each equal to AD. So AE is also equal to C.
---
Thus, for two given unequal straight-lines, AB and C, the (straight-line) AE, equal to the lesser C, has been cut off from the greater AB. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

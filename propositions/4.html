<strong>If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal straight lines equal, then they will also have the base equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles.</strong>

Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF, respectively, (that is) AB to DE, and AC to DF. And let the angle BAC be equal to the angle EDF. I say that the base BC is also equal to the base EF, and triangle ABC will be equal to triangle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles. (That is) ABC to DEF, and ACB to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">.

For if triangle ABC is applied to triangle DEF, the point A being placed on the point D, and the straight-line AB on DE, then the point B will also coincide with <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, on account of AB being equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4">. So (because of) AB coinciding with DE, the straight-line AC will also coincide with <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5">, on account of the angle BAC being equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q6">. So the point C will also coincide with the point <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q7">, again on account of AC being equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q8">. But, if point B certainly also coincided with point <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q9">, so that the base BC will coincide with the base <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q10">. For if B coincides with E, and C with F, and the base BC does not coincide with EF, then two straight lines will encompass an area. The very thing is impossible. Thus, the base BC will coincide with <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q11">, and will be equal to it. So the whole triangle ABC will coincide with the whole triangle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q12">, and will be equal to it. And the remaining angles will coincide with the remaining angles, and will be equal to them. (That is) ABC to DEF, and ACB to DFE.

Thus, if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal straight lines equal, then they will also have the base equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles. This is what needed to be demonstrated.

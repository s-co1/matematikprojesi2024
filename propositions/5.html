<strong>For isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another.</strong>

Let ABC be an isosceles triangle having the side AB equal to the side <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">, and let the straight lines BD and CE have been produced in a straight line with AB and AC (respectively). I say that the angle ABC is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">, and angle CBD to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">.

For let the point F have been taken at random on <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4">, and let AG have been cut off from the greater AE, equal to the lesser AF [Prop. 1.3]. Also, let the straight lines FC and GB have been joined [Post. 1].

In fact, since AF is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5">, and AB to AC, respectively, the two straight lines FA, AC are equal to the two straight lines GA, AB, respectively. They also encompass a common angle, <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q6">. Thus, the base FC is equal to the base GB, and the triangle AFC will be equal to the triangle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q7">, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4]. That is, angle ACF to angle ABG, and angle AFC to angle AGB. And since the whole of AF is equal to the whole of <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q8">, within which AB is equal to AC, the remainder BCF is thus equal to the remainder CG [C.N. 3]. But FC was also shown to be equal to GB. So the two straight lines FC, GB are equal to the two straight lines CG, respectively, and the angle BFC is equal to the angle CGB, and the base <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q9"> is common to them.

Thus, the triangle BFC will be equal to the triangle CGB, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4]. Therefore, since the whole angle ABG was shown to be equal to the whole angle AFC, within which CGB is equal to BCF, the remainder ABC is thus equal to the remainder ACB [C.N. 3]. And they are at the base of triangle ABC. And BFC was also shown to be equal to CGB. And they are under the base.

Thus, for isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another, and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another. Which is the very thing it was required to show.

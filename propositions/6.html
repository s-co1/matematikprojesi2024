<strong>If a triangle has two angles equal to one another, then the sides subtending the equal angles will also be equal to one another.</strong>

Let ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC equal to the angle ACB. I say that side AB is also equal to side AC.

For if AB is unequal to AC, then one of them is greater. Let AB be greater, and let DB, equal to AC, have been cut off from the greater AB. And let <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> have been joined .Therefore, since DB is equal to AC, and BC is common, the two sides DB, BC are equal to the two sides AC, CB, respectively, and the angle DBC is equal to the angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">. Thus, the base DC is equal to the base <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, and the triangle DBC will be equal to the triangle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> [Prop. 1.4], the lesser to the greater. The very notion is absurd [C.N. 5]. Thus, AB is not unequal to AC. Thus, it is equal.

Thus, if a triangle has two angles equal to one another, then the sides subtending the equal angles will also be equal to one another. Which is the very thing it was required to show.

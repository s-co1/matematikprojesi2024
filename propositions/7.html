<strong>On the same straight-line, two other straight-lines equal, respectively, to two given straight-lines cannot be constructed (meeting) at a different point on the same side of the straight-line but having the same ends as the given straight-lines.</strong>

For if possible, let the two straight-lines AC, CB be equal to two other straight-lines AD, DB, respectively, have been constructed on the same straight-line <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">, meeting at different points, C and D, on the same side of AB and having the same ends on AB, such that CA is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">, and CB is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, and let CD have been joined.
---
Therefore, since AC is equal to AD, angle ACD is also equal to angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4">. Thus, angle ADC is greater than angle DCB. Again, since CB is equal to DB, angle CDB is also equal to angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5">. But it was shown that angle ADC is also much greater than angle DCB. The very thing is impossible.

Thus, on the same straight-line, two other straight-lines equal, respectively, to two given straight-lines (which meet) cannot be constructed (meeting) at a different point on the same side of the straight-line, but having the same ends as the given straight-lines. Which is the very thing it was required to show.

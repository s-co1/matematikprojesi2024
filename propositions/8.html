<strong>If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, and also have the base equal to the base, then they will also have equal the angles encompassed by the equal straight-lines. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.</strong>

Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF, respectively. (That is) AB to DE, and AC to DF. Let them also have the base BC equal to the base EF. I say that the angle BAC is also equal to the angle <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1">.

For if triangle ABC is applied to triangle DEF, the point B being placed on point <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">, and the straight-line BC on <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, then point C will also coincide with <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4">, on account of BC being equal to EF. So (because of) BC coinciding with EF, (the sides) BA and CA will also coincide with <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5"> and <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q6"> (respectively). For if base BC coincides with base EF, but the sides AB and AC do not coincide with ED and DF (respectively), but miss like EG and GF (in the above figure).

Then we will have constructed upon the same straight-line, two other straight-lines equal, respectively, to two (given) straight-lines, and (meeting) at a different point on the same side (of the straight-line), but having the same ends. But (such straight-lines) cannot be constructed [Prop. 1.7]. Thus, the base BC being applied to the base EF, the sides BA and AC cannot not coincide with ED and DF (respectively). Thus, they will coincide. So the angle BAC will also coincide with angle EDF, and will be equal to it.

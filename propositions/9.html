<strong>To cut a given rectilinear angle in half.</strong>
---
Let BAC be the given rectilinear angle. So it is required to cut it in half.
---
Let the point D have been taken at random on AB, and let AE, equal to AD, have been cut off from AC [Prop. 1.3], and let <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q1"> have been joined. And let the equilateral triangle DEF have been constructed upon DE [Prop. 1.1], and let AF have been joined. I say that the angle BAC has been cut in half by the straight-line <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q2">.

For since AD is equal to <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q3">, and <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q4"> is common, the two (straight-lines) DA, AF are equal to the two (straight-lines) EA, AF, respectively. And the base DF is equal to the base <input type="text" class="panelelement" id="q5">. Thus, angle DAF is equal to angle EAF [Prop. 1.8].
Thus, the given rectilinear angle BAC has been cut in half by the straight-line AF. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
